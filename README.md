# Calculator

Calculator Project

This is a webpage that stimulates a calculator that does basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
division. The user can input numbers by pressing buttons, and then pressing an operator and inputting another number. They can
do as long of a chain of operators and numbers as they want as long as they press enter when they put in a number. There will be
a mini display at the top of the display bar which shows the current chain of numbers and operators. Users can delete digits with
the DEL button or clear everything with the CLR button.

For this project, I just used HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript.
